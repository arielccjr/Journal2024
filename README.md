        : NICOMACHEAN ETHICS: explores the nature of human happiness (eudaimonia), virtue (arete), and the role of reason in ethical decision-making. 
            ~1: The Highest Good is Happiness (Eudaimonia). 
                Every human action aims at some good.
                The highest good must be self-sufficient (worth pursuing for its own sake).
                Happiness (eudaimonia) is the ultimate goal of human life.
            ~2: Happiness is Achieved Through Virtue. 
                Happiness is not mere pleasure or wealth but a life of rational activity in accordance with virtue.
                Two types of virtues:
                    Moral Virtues (e.g., courage, temperance, justice) – developed through habit.
                    Intellectual Virtues (e.g., wisdom, understanding) – developed through reason and education.
            ~3: Virtue is a Habit Between Extremes (Doctrine of the Mean). 
                Virtue is the golden mean between two vices:
                    Deficiency (too little of a trait)
                    Excess (too much of a trait)
                Example: Courage is the mean between cowardice (deficiency) and recklessness (excess).
            ~4: Moral Development Requires Practical Wisdom (Phronesis). 
                Practical wisdom is the ability to judge what is virtuous in different situations.
                It requires experience, reflection, and rational deliberation.
            ~5: The Role of Friendship and Society. 
                A good life is lived within a community (polis).
                True friendship is based on virtue, not just utility or pleasure.
                The best society cultivates virtuous citizens through education and law.
            ~6: The Contemplative Life is the Highest Life. 
                The best life is one of philosophical contemplation, where reason governs all aspects of life.
                However, those engaged in politics or social roles should also aim for virtue in action.

                : Pathos (Emotional Appeal): Persuasion must engage the audience’s emotions to motivate action. Uses vivid storytelling, analogies, and emotional triggers to influence perception.

                : Forensic (Judicial) Rhetoric – Concerned with past actions (e.g., guilt or innocence in legal cases).
                : Epideictic (Ceremonial) Rhetoric – Concerned with praise or blame (e.g., speeches at events, eulogies).

                : MEANING:                  Let me ask a bigger question: Are we bound by our habits or do we act out of our free will?

                : TRANSITION:               First: why are we slaves of our passions? 
            ~2: NARRATION (Narratio):       Presents background information and context.
                : Support:                  You probably "understand" the way I learn English:
                : TRANSITION:               But what if this is only half-true?
            ~3: PROOF (Confirmatio):        Develops logical (logos) arguments with supporting evidence.
                : Introduction:             Computers

                : QUESTION:                 So, are we simply animals flowing along the current of passion, or do we have free will? 
                : THESIS:                   We are capable of both — of habits, but empowered to rise above them.
                : Meaning:                  This question matters because it shows how If we believe we have no choice, 
                : Review Points:
                    Main Point 1:           Habits and instincts strongly influence our behavior.
                    Main Point 2:           Self-awareness, delayed gratification, and cultural evolution prove our capacity for free will.
                    Main Point 3:           Addressing counterarguments reveals the balance between instinct and choice.
                : CLOSING:                  Ultimately, the power to choose defines what it means to be human.
