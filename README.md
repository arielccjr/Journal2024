        : GEOMETRY: EUCLID.
        : ARITHMETIC: NICOMACHUS.
    ~1: REASON/PHILOSOPHY (TRIVIUM):
        ~3: RHETORIC.
            : SOPHISTICAL ELENCHI,
            : TOPICS,
        ~2: DIALECTIC.
            : ANALYTICS:
                : PRIOR,
                : POSTERIOR.   
            : LOGISTICAL CONSISTENCY:
                : Simple Conversion: Universal negative (E) and particular affirmative (I) can directly swap subject and predicate.
                : Limited Conversion: Universal affirmative (A) converts to a particular affirmative (I) to maintain truth.
                : Direct Reduction: Simplify syllogism by converting it into the first figure.
                : Indirect Reduction (Reductio ad Absurdum): Prove validity by showing contradiction if the conclusion were denied.
            : SYLLOGISTIC RULES:
                : Rule of Distribution: The middle term must be distributed in at least one premise.
                : Rule of Quantity and Quality: Two particular premises cannot lead to a valid conclusion.
            : SYLLOGISTIC FIGURES: the structural forms that classify syllogisms by the position of the middle term in the premises
                : 1. First Figure (AAA) - Barbara
                    Form: The middle term is the subject of the major premise and the predicate of the minor premise.
                    Mood: AAA (All - All - All)
                    Example:
                        Premise 1 (Major): All humans are mortal. (A)
                        Premise 2 (Minor): All Greeks are humans. (A)
                        Conclusion: Therefore, all Greeks are mortal. (A)
                    Explanation: In Barbara, both premises and the conclusion are universal affirmatives (A), forming a valid syllogism where the middle term connects the major and minor terms in a way that makes the conclusion logically necessary.
                
                : 2. Second Figure (EAE) - Camestres
                    Form: The middle term is the predicate of both the major and minor premises.
                    Mood: EAE (No - All - No)
                    Example:
                        Premise 1 (Major): No reptiles are warm-blooded. (E)
                        Premise 2 (Minor): All snakes are reptiles. (A)
                        Conclusion: Therefore, no snakes are warm-blooded. (E)
                    Explanation: In Camestres, the premises use a combination of universal negative (E) and universal affirmative (A) statements. The conclusion logically follows as a universal negative (E), based on the exclusive nature of the premises.

                : 3. Third Figure (IAI) - Datisi
                    Form: The middle term is the subject of both the major and minor premises.
                    Mood: IAI (Some - All - Some)
                    Example:
                        Premise 1 (Major): Some animals are herbivores. (I)
                        Premise 2 (Minor): All animals are living beings. (A)
                        Conclusion: Therefore, some living beings are herbivores. (I)
                    Explanation: In Datisi, the premises combine a particular affirmative (I) and a universal affirmative (A) statement. The conclusion is a particular affirmative (I), following the pattern of reasoning through partial overlap in the category.

                : 4. Fourth Figure (Added by later logicians)
                    Form: The middle term is the predicate of the major premise and the subject of the minor premise.
                    Explanation: The fourth figure was added by later logicians and includes several moods that follow a less common structure. The conclusion is reached by arranging the middle term in a way that avoids contradiction while ensuring logical consistency.  
            : SYLLOGISM:
                : Major Premise (Universal or Particular, Affirmative or Negative)
                : Minor Premise (Universal or Particular, Affirmative or Negative)
                : Conclusion (Follow rules of distribution and quality to validate)
        ~1: GRAMMAR:
            : CORRECT-PARSE-SYNTAX: 
                : MODAL PROPOSITIONS:
                    : Necessity: Both premises being necessary leads to a necessary conclusion.
                        Example: "Necessarily, all humans are mortal" and "Necessarily, Socrates is human" imply "Necessarily, Socrates is mortal."
                    : Possibility: If one premise is possible, the conclusion may be possible but not certain.
                    : Mixed Modalities: Different modal premises allow conditional or probable conclusions.
                : RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PROPOSITIONS:
                    : Contradiction: A and O (as well as E and I) are contradictory. They cannot both be true or both be false.
                    : Contrariety: A and E are contrary propositions; they cannot both be true simultaneously, but they can both be false.
                    : Subcontrariety: I and O are subcontrary propositions; they can both be true but cannot both be false.
                    : Subalternation: There is a truth dependency from universal to particular (A → I and E → O). If A is true, then I must be true; if E is true, then O must be true.
                : TYPES OF PROPOSITIONS: 
                    : A: Universal Affirmative ("All humans are mortal")
                    : E: Universal Negative ("No humans are mortal")
                    : I: Particular Affirmative ("Some humans are mortal")
                    : O: Particular Negative ("Some humans are not mortal")

                : Accidental Properties (Attributes): Characteristics that vary without changing substance.
                    : Quantity: Measurable aspects (e.g., length, size).
                    : Quality: Characteristics that define "what kind" (e.g., color, emotion).
                    : Position: Arrangement or posture (e.g., sitting).
                    : State: Temporary condition (e.g., asleep, armed).

                    : Relation: Connection between entities (e.g., father of, bigger than).
                    : Place (BY-HERE): Spatial location (e.g., at home).
