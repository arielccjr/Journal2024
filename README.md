: WHAT?
    This repository is a rough journal of my interests.

: WHY THIS REPOSITORY?
    I aim for "Being One With God".

: HOW?
    : Natural Language Processing (NLP):
        In principio erat Verbum, et Verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat Verbum. 
        - Ioannes 1 
        
        GOD = TRINITY: CORRECTNESS/TRUTH, CONTRACT, HONOR/DUTY

        So let it be written, so let it be done.
        -The Pharaoh

    : Computer Vision / Game Development: 
        In principio creavit Deus caelum et terram.
        Terra autem erat inanis et vacua, et tenebrae erant super faciem abyssi: et spiritus Dei ferebatur super aquas.
        Dixitque Deus: Fiat lux. Et facta est lux. 
        - Genesis 1-3

        Quadrahedron = the smallest of all geometrical shapes has four-sided pyramid
        The point within the center of that pyramid is point number five.
        2 objects cannot occupy the same space at the same time: 5 + 5 = 9, or tetrahedron (Star of David)

: NOTE-FOR-SELF:
    : DO NOT READ MODERN (1900-NOW) READINGS.
    : READ WITH ANCIENT LANGUAGES: LATIN, GREEK, HEBREW.
