For the beginning is with the Word.
For the Word is with the Lord.
For the Lord is for the Word.

    IN PRINCIPIO ERAT VERBUM, ET VERBUM ERAT APUD DEUM, ET DEUS ERAT VERBUM." 
    - IOANNES 1

For the beginning is with the creation of the heaven-&-earth by the Lord.
For the earth is without the form (and is with the void).
For the darkness is with the face of the deep. 
For the Spirit of the Lord is with the face of the waters.
For the said(speech) of the Lord is for the light.
    And for the light is with the Lord.

    IN PRINCIPIO CREAVIT DEUS CAELUM ET TERRAM.
    TERRA AUTEM ERAT INANIS ET VACUA, ET TENEBRAE ERANT SUPER FACIEM ABYSSI: ET SPIRITUS DEI FEREBATUR SUPER AQUAS.
    DIXITQUE DEUS: FIAT LUX. ET FACTA EST LUX. 
    - GENESIS 1:1-3
