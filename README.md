                : TRANSITION:           First: why are we slaves of our passions? 
            ~NARRATION (Narratio):      Presents background information and context.
                : Support:              You probably "understand" the way I learn English:
                : TRANSITION:           But what if this is only half-true?
            ~PROOF (Confirmatio):       Develops logical (logos) arguments with supporting evidence.
                : Introduction:         Computers 
                : Transition:           Let’s revisit the counterarguments and see why they don’t entirely negate free will.”
            ~REFUTATION (Refutatio):    Anticipates counterarguments and disproves them.
                : Main Refutation:
                : Refute 1st:           We cannot memorize words by dictionary. Languages are homonymous. Wan plus too ease three? "What is written is what is done."

                : QUESTION:             So, are we simply animals flowing along the current of passion, or do we have free will? 
                : THESIS:               We are capable of both — of habits, but empowered to rise above them.
                : Meaning:              This question matters because it shows how If we believe we have no choice, 
                : Review Points:
                    Main Point 1:       Habits and instincts strongly influence our behavior.
                    Main Point 2:       Self-awareness, delayed gratification, and cultural evolution prove our capacity for free will.
                    Main Point 3:       Addressing counterarguments reveals the balance between instinct and choice.
                : Closing:              Ultimately, the power to choose defines what it means to be human.
