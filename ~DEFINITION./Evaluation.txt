    3. FELT = Motions, Emotions

        +Irony for Humor: A curve-ball! ei.
        "You wont believe what happened this year!"
        "Okay, nothing new happened  this year!" 

IMPROVEMENT+CHALLENGE:
    There is little left that Toastmasters program can offer as lesson to a distinguished speaker as Rob James, 
    But for improvement, I challenge you, Rob:
        +Add more poetry tools, such as more rhymes, more onomatopoeia "sound effect"
        +Experiment with  some animation techniques, such as in silent films, exaggerated body movements
    I encourage Rob the experimentation with more artistic tools, for having the old experiences new again.
