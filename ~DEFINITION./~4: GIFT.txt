~TITLE:                     How do we know each other? How do we find closure?
~INTRODUCTION (Exordium) – Establishes credibility (ethos) and engages the audience.
    : HOOK QUESTION:        Have you ever cursed, like that? Is this by instinct, or by choice?
    : MEANING:              Let me ask a bigger question: Are we bound by our habits or do we act out of our free will?
    : THESIS:               This speech shares 
                            we have free will — the ability to choose.”
                            ~1: First, 
                            ~2: Then,
                            ~3: And finally, 
    : TRANSITION:           First: why are we slaves of our passions? 
~NARRATION (Narratio) – Presents background information and context.
    : Support:              You probably "understand" the way I learn English:
                            And you are probabaly right, because...
                            First, we learn the letters, 
                            Then, we memorize words, by the dictionary, if we care enough.
                            And finally, we arrange these words in a sentence/clause, using grammar and parts of speech.
                                Subject, predicate.
                                Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, Adverbs, Preposition, Articles, 
                                Past-tense, Future-tense.
                            Most of the time, we learn new words by pop culture / daily conversation,
                            
                            "We never left 2nd-grade reading/comprehension level."
                            "At the end of the day, we cannot read and write knowledge, facts, and even laws on our own,
                            "We are at the mercy of our lawyers for reaching closure."
                            
    : Transition:           But what if this is only half-true?
                            What if there is another way? What if we can read / write the truth on our own?
~PROOF (Confirmatio) – Develops logical (logos) arguments with supporting evidence.
    : Introduction:         Computers 
                            They process languages using arithmetic and logic unit.
                            Breaking down images, sounds, and videos into 0s and 1s.
                            Instead of using dictionary, we learn words by roots and fixes, by etymology.
                                For example, 
                            And finally, we arrange words by these 3-sequence: Position-Lodial-Fact.
    : Transition:           Let’s revisit the counterarguments and see why they don’t entirely negate free will.”
~REFUTATION (Refutatio) – Anticipates counterarguments and disproves them.
    : Main Refutation:
    : Refute 1st:           We cannot memorize words by dictionary. Languages are homonymous. Wan plus too ease three? "What is written is what is done."
                            Language are ambiguous, with many definition.
                            Words rely on arrangement of their neighboring words for meaning, violating parts of speech and grammar.
                            Natural language 
    : Transition:
~CONCLUSION (Peroratio) – Reinforces key points and leaves a lasting impression, often with pathos.E
    : QUESTION:             So, are we simply animals flowing along the current of passion, or do we have free will? 
    : THESIS:               We are capable of both — of habits, but empowered to rise above them.
    : Meaning:              This question matters because it shows how If we believe we have no choice, we remain trapped. But if we recognize our free will, we can consciously shape our lives.”
    : Review Points:
        Main Point 1:       Habits and instincts strongly influence our behavior.
        Main Point 2:       Self-awareness, delayed gratification, and cultural evolution prove our capacity for free will.
        Main Point 3:       Addressing counterarguments reveals the balance between instinct and choice.
    : Closing:              Ultimately, the power to choose defines what it means to be human. 
                            Let’s not flow passively along the currents of passion but take control of the rudder and steer toward the lives we truly want. 
                            Thank you, Mr. Toastmaster.
