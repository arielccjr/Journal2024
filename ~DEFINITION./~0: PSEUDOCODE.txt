		~2: Scan/check document for the following F.-S.-G. & add each one to BASIC-SYNTAX-KEY-CODE, that you find in the document.
		~3: SYNTAX ONLY THE FIRST SENTENCE OF EVERY PARAGRAPH.

		~12: Place FULL-SIZE FENCE at all places where there is PUNCTUATION of VOID-CONTINUANCE.
		~13: Find & mark all ADVERBS=1, -ly=1, & mark all CONJUNCTIONS=0.

	: ADVERB-SYNTAX-RULES:
		: RULE-1: For the -ly-ADVERBS stay an ADVERB-ALWAYS.
		: RULE-2: NO MORE THAN THREE-ADVERBS IN A ROW. 
			SAMPLE= 1 1 1
		: RULE-3: If there is only one word to the RIGHT of an ADVERB it will always be MODIFIED into a VERB=2. 
			SAMPLE= 1 2.
		: RULE-4: If there is only one word to the LEFT of an ADVERB it will always be MODIFIED into a PRONOUN=4.
			SAMPLE= 4 1
		: RULE-5: If there are TWO or more words to the LEFT of an ADVERB, 
			it will always be MODIFIED into this ADJECTIVE>PRONOUN= 3 4 1
			SAMPLE= 3 4 1
		: RULE-6: If there are TWO or more words to the RIGHT of an ADVERB, 
			it will always be  MODIFIED into this ADJECTIVE>PRONOUN= 3 4.
			SAMPLE= 1 3 4
		: RULE-7: An ADVERB farthest to the right, at the end of the sentence(full-fence, punctuation), will convert to a VERB=2, FIRST.
			SAMPLE= 1 1 1 1. converts to 1 1 1 2.
		: RULE-8: you would write if there was only one adverb and it was at the very end of the sentence you're going to convert it to a 4 with the exception or a note for yourself if that word the last word before the period or the question mark of the explanation mark if it was an l y suffix word like family or sincerely then it will not convert to a two or four i'm sorry a four because l y always stays a one oh it and that would be your rule eight.
		: RULE-8: It there are two adverbs at the end of a sentence, the last adverb gets converted to a verb. 
			( The rule only applies if the sentence ends with a (.), (?) or (!)
			and doesn’t end with a (,), (:), (;), ([]) or (). 
		: RULE-9: If the last word at the end of a sentence is an adverb, 
			it’ll be converted into a pronoun, unless it ended in (-ly). 
			A conjunction stays a conjunction. 
			The word before the last (-ly) word would convert to a pronoun. 	
		: RULE-10: An adverb before a conjunction remains an adverb, 
			because it’s not the end of a sentence or punctuation.
